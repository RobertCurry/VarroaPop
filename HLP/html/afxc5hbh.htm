<P><A NAME="hidd_action_form"></A><A NAME="actions"></A><B>Actions</B></P>

<P>There are two actions that can be performed on the colony; re-queening and Varroa treatment.  Each of these actions may be performed independently of each other.</P>

<P><B>Re-queening</B></P>

<P>A new queen can be added during the simulation by enabling the Re-queening action.  If an automatic re-queening is selected, only the strength of the new queen and the delay between the appearance of the new queen and the resumption of egg-laying needs to be specified.  Normally, the egg laying delay is 10 days.  If a scheduled re-queening is selected, the queen strength and egg-laying delay must still be specified.  In addition to these parameters, the initial re-queening date must be selected and a choice must be made to either re-queen once on that date or annually beginning on that date.</P>

<P><B>Varroa Treatment</B></P>

<P>A Varroa mite treatment can be simulated by enabling the Varroa Treatment action.  The treatment start date is selected as well as the duration of treatment and the daily percent mortality specified by the treatment agent.  Typical daily mortalities are 90 to 98 percent.  In addition, the desired percentage of Varroa mites that are resistant to the treatment can be specified.  A typical number for resistant mites is 5 percent.</P>
