<P><A NAME="hidd_colony_data_form"></A><A NAME="colony_data"></A><B>Colony Data </B></P>

<P>At the top of the Colony Data tab is a pull-down menu that will display all existing colony files ( files that have a “.col”  extension to their filename) in the current directory.  If you select one of these, the initial conditions in that colony file will be displayed.  Alternatively, you can type the name of a new colony file and the data you have entered will be saved under that name when you exit VarroaPop or when you select <A HREF="afxc9y05.htm">Save</A> or Save As  The colony name must not contain an extension (e.g. “.col”).</P>

<P>The fields for Eggs, Larvae, Capped Brood and Adult Bees for both Worker and Drones can range between 0 and 1,000,000.  The Mite Bionomics fields are offspring per mite for Varroa in Worker and Drone brood cells.  This value can range from 0 to 5.  The meaning of the value 1.5 entered in one of these fields is that a mother mite will produce 1.5 offspring for a total of 2.5 varroa emerging.  Note: the actual emergence is somewhat lower than this number due to mortality factors.  Mite Survivorship and Percent Varroa Infestation in Capped Brood and Adults can range from 0 to 100.  </P>

<P>Queen Strength is a relative measure of the queen’s maximum egg-laying ability and the amount of sperm she has in her spermatheca.  A Strong queen indicates one with 5.5 million sperm and a maximum egg-laying potential of 3000 per day while a Weak queen has 1.8 million sperm and a maximum egg-laying potential of 1000 per day.    </P>

<P>The distance foragers have to travel to find food affects forager Lifespan.  A nominal lifespan is 10 days but if there is a long distance between the colony and the food source, the lifespan will be shorter.  Conversely, a short distance to food would result in a longer forager lifespan.</P>

<P>Sliding the rectangular indicators to the left or right will set the desired value for both Queen Strength and Forager Lifespan.</P>
